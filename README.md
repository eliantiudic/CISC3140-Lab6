# CISC3140-Lab6

I started out by doing the git task.  
I found this task much easier than the svn one because I've used git before so I was familiar with how it works.  
What I liked about using git is that it has a lot of information online so if I find myself stuck or not knowing how to accomplish a certain task I can just google it.  

The svn task took a bit longer since I didn't use this vcs before and the workflow took a while to get into.  
The book linked in the assignment doc was very helpful because I couldn't really find much info outside of it online.  
The details given about the workflow really helped but it took a while to find them since the book was pretty comprehensive.  
What I found difficult about using svn was setting up the "server".  
I'm used to just creating a git repo and getting to work.  
The task of creating the working directory and the server repo was what took the longest.  
Once the working copy was created, I found that making and commiting changes using svn was a bit easier than using git since I didn't have to push any changes, it did that automatically.  

Overall, I didn't find the two vcs to be all that much different.
